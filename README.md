# House-Sales-in-King-County-USA
I will be exploring the housing sale prices in King County, USA between the time period May 2014 - May 2015.
Firstly, I will go through a thorough data exploration to identify most important features and to explore the intercorrelation between features. After that I apply data normalization between varialbes and conduct feature engineering, Finally, I will be applying different machine learning algorithms and evaluating their respective success to a cross-validated splitted train-test set.
